#Fire Alarm System with Arduino, GSM, Buzzer, and Flame Sensor

Overview:
The Fire Alarm System is a project developed using Arduino microcontroller along with a GSM module, buzzer, and flame sensor. It is designed to detect the presence of fire and send an alert message to predefined phone numbers via SMS, while also activating a buzzer alarm to alert people nearby.

Components:
Arduino Board: Acts as the main microcontroller unit to control the system.
GSM Module: Enables communication with mobile networks to send SMS alerts.
Buzzer: Produces audible alarms when fire is detected.
Flame Sensor: Detects the presence of fire or flames.

Operation:
Flame Detection: The flame sensor continuously monitors the environment for the presence of flames or fire.
Fire Detection Algorithm: When flames are detected, the Arduino triggers the alarm system.
Alert Message: The Arduino communicates with the GSM module to send an SMS alert message to predefined phone numbers, notifying them of the fire incident.
Buzzer Activation: Simultaneously, the buzzer is activated to produce loud audible alarms, alerting people nearby.

Installation:
Connect the components according to the provided circuit diagram.
Upload the Arduino sketch provided in the repository to the Arduino board.
Configure the GSM module with appropriate SIM card and settings.
Ensure the system is powered properly and positioned in an appropriate location for fire detection.

Usage:
Power on the system and monitor the flame sensor for fire detection.
When flames are detected, the system will automatically trigger the alarm and send SMS alerts.
Respond to the alert messages accordingly and take necessary actions to mitigate the fire risk.
